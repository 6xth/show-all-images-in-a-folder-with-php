##### A simple PHP script to list all images in a folder.

When I work on homepage or mobile layouts, or anything like that, i prefer to first sketch things up on a piece of paper, or in Photoshop. Then after I have a couple of ideas, I take photos of my paper-sketches, make png files of my PSD ideas, and show it all to the client. After receiving feedback I make any changes required, and show everything to the client again. Sometimes it turns out to be a lot of images.

The way I use to show it to the client is by giving them a link to a place where i keep this one PHP file, and a ‘img’ folder where i keep all the images in. The PHP file automatically shows all the images in this folder, and I don’t have to manually update anything, just upload to the folder. You can also use this as a simple photo album with your holiday pictures if you’d like.
